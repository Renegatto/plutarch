 __Explanation for hoisted terms:__
 Hoisting is a convenient way of importing terms without duplicating them
 across your tree. Currently, hoisting is only supported on terms that do
 not refer to any free variables.

 An RHoisted contains a term and its hash. A RawTerm will have a DAG
 of hoisted terms, where an edge represents a dependency.
 We topologically sort these hoisted terms, such that each has an index.

 We wrap our RawTerm in RLamAbs and RApply in an order corresponding to the
 indices. Each level can refer to levels above it by the nature of De Bruijn naming,
 though the name is relative to the current level.

 Source: Unembedding Domain-Specific Languages by Robert Atkey, Sam Lindley, Jeremy Yallop
 Thanks!
 NB: Hoisted terms must be sorted such that the dependents are first and dependencies last.

 s: This parameter isn't ever instantiated with something concrete. It is merely here
 to ensure that `compile` and `phoistAcyclic` only accept terms without any free variables.

 __Explanation of how the unembedding works:__
 Each term must be instantiated with its de-Bruijn level.
 `plam'`, given its own level, will create an `RVar` that figures out the
 de-Bruijn index needed to reach its own level given the level it itself is
 instantiated with.
